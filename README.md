# Utilities for the CS Simply educational material

This repo contains several utilies to help teachers teach the content of the
Computer Science Simply series (Einfach Informatik) developped at ETHZ.

## TODO

- [ ] Better organize files
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Refactor code (write a `Cypher` base class and let the other cyphers
      derive from it)
- [ ] Refactor `CaesarCypher` and others to use the new `utils.shift_char` function
